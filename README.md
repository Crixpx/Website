## Introduction

My friend is into 'nulling' websites, later on gave the files to me. 
Then I decided to turn it into WoW registration site.

## Install

WIKI: https://github.com/Project-Reborn/Website/wiki

Installation is pretty easy, copy all the files into your 'htdocs' or 'www' folder. 
After doing that, head over to index.php to match the settings with your databases.

Want a forum? Paste your phpbb, mybb, vbulletin or something else into the \forum folder. I advice using mybb!
